<div id="left"><div id='headd1'>Chicken</div><br><br><br>A large chicken (around 1.5kg/3lbs 5oz) will feed a family of four with leftovers for a salad or pasta dish the next day. A stock can be made from the carcass and turned into a risotto or broth on the third night. It's often considerably cheaper to buy a whole chicken and joint it yourself, than to buy ready-prepared breasts and leg joints. Whole chickens tend to be sold trussed (tied with string) - remove this and pull the legs gently away from the body to ensure even cooking. Sprinkling the skin with sea salt before roasting will help to crisp it up.</div>

<div id="center"><div id='headd2'>Beef</div><br><br><br>The origin of the name is unclear, with no definite connection to Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington.[1]

Leah Hyslop, writing in The Telegraph, observes that by the time Wellington became famous, meat baked in pastry was a well-established part of English cuisine, and that the dish's similarity to the French filet de bœuf en croûte (fillet of beef in pastry) might imply that "Beef Wellington" was a "timely patriotic rebranding of a trendy continental dish".[2] However, she cautions, there are no 19th century recipes for the dish. There is a mention of "fillet of beef, a la Wellington" in The Los Angeles Times of 1903.</div>

<div id="right"><div id='headd3'>Sushi</div><br><br><br>Sushi originates in a Southeast Asian dish, known today as narezushi (馴れ寿司, 熟寿司 – "salted fish"), stored in fermented rice for possibly months at a time. The lacto-fermentation of the rice prevented the fish from spoiling;[1] the rice would be discarded before consumption of the fish.[2] This early type of sushi became an important source of protein for its Japanese consumers. The term sushi comes from an antiquated grammatical form no longer used in other contexts, and literally means "sour-tasting"; the overall dish has a sour and umami or savoury taste.[3] Narezushi still exists as a regional specialty, notably as funa-zushi from Shiga Prefecture.</div>
